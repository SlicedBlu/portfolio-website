                    <span>I'm a 22 year old graduate from SUNY Albany, currently living in Brewerton, NY.<br></br>
                    I'm proud to have graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science, for both a Major in Computer Science and Minor in Mathematics.
                    My father assisted me when I was very little with my interest in technology, and as I grew, so did both my interest and my talents.
                    I am excited to step into my field and will no doubt show extraordinary work ethic and eagerness to learn.</span>
